/**
 * Exercise 2 — Startup coordination with {@link CountDownLatch}.
 *
 * Scenario: a coordinator thread must wait until a fixed number of worker
 * threads have finished their startup phase before allowing work to begin.
 *
 * Your tasks:
 *
 * (A) Implement {@link #launchAndWait(int)}.
 *     - Create a {@code CountDownLatch} with the given {@code workerCount}.
 *     - Start {@code workerCount} threads.  Each thread must:
 *         1. Record its name in the {@code startedNames} list (use a
 *            {@code synchronized} block on the list).
 *         2. Call {@code countDown()} on the latch.
 *     - After starting all threads, call {@code latch.await()} on the main
 *       calling thread so it blocks until all workers have checked in.
 *     - After {@code await()} returns, set {@code allStarted = true}.
 *
 * (B) Understand the difference from a plain {@code join()} loop:
 *     A {@code CountDownLatch} lets the workers keep running after they
 *     signal; {@code join()} would wait for the thread to fully terminate.
